Code for IEEE Tcom paper: [Sensing Userâ€™s Activity, Channel, and Location with Near-Field Extra-Large-Scale MIMO](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10286475)

## Keywods:

#### Near-Field Communication; Extra-Large-Scale MIMO; Milimeter-Wave Communication

#### Near-Feild Localization; 

#### Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC)


## Usuage

Functions may utilize pagemtimes and pageinv to circumvent the use of for loops, requiring Matlab 2022a or a more recent version. However, it's possible to modify these functions to employ for loops, making them compatible with older versions of Matlab.

The code can be adapted for parfor to decrease the execution time.
